# Base Conversations

Conversations are expected to be in a JSON file with the following format:
```json
[
    {
        "role": "<role>",
        "content": "<content>"
    },
    ...
]
```

### Using Variables in Conversation

Variables that may change at runtime and are independent of the convesation can be set using the python format string notation of `{var_name}`. An example JSON, unrelated to your home description is available under the key `smart_home_data_example` and your description of your home is loaded under the name `smart_home_data`. Any other variables should be manually named and set in the `model_configs/<config_file>.yaml` under the `conversation_vars` key.

```yaml
# Model Config File
conversation_vars:
    my_name: lovey
```

```json
// Conversation File
"content": "My name is {my_name} and here is a JSON description of my house: {smart_home_data}"
```

# Using String JSON in Conversation

To use in text JSON in your conversations, you must escape the content using two sets of brackets `{{<your json>}}`. This will resolve to a single pair of brackets after being loaded.

```json
"content": "Representing some JSON: {{\"key\": \"value\"}} with a variable {var_name}"
```
