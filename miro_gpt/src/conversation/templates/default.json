To manage the state of these devices and to communicate changes to their state I'd like to use a JSON data structure like this simplified example:\n\n{smart_home_data_example}\n\nCan you modify the relevant parts of the JSON each time I ask you, and then reply with the modified parts? For example, if I say 'Turn on the kitchen light' you would change the value of the 'kitchen_light' value to 'on', and reply with:\n\n```json\n\t\"kitchen_light\": \"on\"\n```\n\nDoes that make sense?"
